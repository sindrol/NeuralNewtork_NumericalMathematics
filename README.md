# NeuralNewtork_NumericalMathematics

A machinelearning-project as part of the subject "Numerical Mathematics" on NTNU. 
A neural network-method is built from basics, and then used to make neural networks that predicts the output from different Hamiltonian functions.

Made in collaboration with Jostine A. Aanes and Markus Tr√¶tli.
