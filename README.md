# NeuralNewtork_NumericalMathematics

A machinelearning-project as part of the subject "Numerical Mathematics" at NTNU. 
A neural network-method is built from basics, and then used to make neural networks that predicts the output from different Hamiltonian functions. Thereafter, numerical solvers of ODEs are used to find trajectories where the Hamiltonians were constant.

Made in collaboration with Jostine A. Aanes and Markus Tr√¶tli.
